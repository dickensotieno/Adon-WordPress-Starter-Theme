/**
 * Filters are functions that WordPress passes data through, at certain points
 * in execution, just before taking some action with the data (such as adding
 * it to the database or sending it to the browser screen). Filters sit between
 * the database and the browser (when WordPress is generating pages), and
 * between the browser and the database (when WordPress is adding new posts and
 * comments to the database); most input and output in WordPress passes through
 * at least one filter. WordPress does some filtering by default, and your
 * plugin can add its own filtering.
